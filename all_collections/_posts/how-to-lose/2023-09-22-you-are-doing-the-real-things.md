# You're doing the real thing (draft)

**Introduction.** **Your business and your personality**

---

“Blah, I’m just coloring buttons here,” “I’m meticulously rearranging JSONs,” “Interests: low-quality programming” - quotes in which my friends describe their work. They describe it so "ironically" and "funny", but after several answers it a way like this, and you want to die. I say things like this too. And I have believed it.

I also have several entrepreneur friends with businesses of varying degrees of success. I love listening to them talk about their development, how they notice certain traits in themselves and to learn what they are going to improve themselves or their lifestyle. I'm always amazed at how what they say resonates with my career as a developer. I am basically a techie and perhaps it sounds naive, but it seems to me that those who deal with information technology often turn out to be good entrepreneurs.

And the difference between a modest developer and an entrepreneur is in the level of pathos. If the first one says that he transferred the json, then the second one will tell how he solved someone’s pain. They did the same thing tbh.

**Honesty. How to understand what you are doing and not be afraid to talk about it to others**

How do we realize our dreams? That's right, we need a roadmap, a plan and a pinch of will to see it through. Is there something else?

Man is a social being and our goals most likely do not exist in isolation from society. The people around us give us a lot, and in return we try to give something back.
It seems that all movement in our lives is built based on exchange. And it is ethical when you have met the expectations and given back what was invested in you in a fair proportion.

The funny thing is that people can't handle their way and return back all things they've got. Not because they are somehow unethical, but because it can be difficult to manage resources wisely.

The first story is about how I went freelance. Ever since university I wanted to go upwork and freelance, working from home and earning dollars. I looked at the $20 rates and was like: Whoaaa.

I did it. Once, while working in a full-time company, I made myself a resume, came to the upwork and set myself a rate of $10. And I won my first order, fixed price for $100. It was the beginning of a new business and the development of a new area. It promised so much, I was one step away from the freedom I dreamed of.
Have you ever decided that you need something and didn't admit to yourself that you couldn't afford it?

It was hard to work on two full-time jobs. I was freaked out the first time I ordered it, but I made it and received a five-star rating. It turned out to be a lot more work, all this was done on an outdated stack: [ASP.NET](http://ASP.NET) MVC + jquery. Everything was done after the main work. ended up getting very tired

But the customer was satisfied. And he offered another project also for a hundred bucks. I liked what I did and I didn’t listen to myself, but wanted more feedback and was like: let’s do it.
It turned out to be even worse, there was an online store and I was essentially forced to straighten out pictures. I sat with them again for a week and did not admit that I did not need it.

I tried to force myself, I was afraid to admitthat I was not interested and you know what I did? One day I closed the lid of my laptop and never returned to freelancing.

It was a great experience of my goatiness. I didn’t want to harm anyone, I believed in myself and in the end I deceived myself and everyone. It’s cool to be honest with yourself, and then honesty with everyone will follow. We need to be able to objectively talk about ourselves, I am currently keeping a diary in search of a tool for this. If you are honest with yourself, you can see when things are going wrong.

**ACT 2. Insolence. How to do something you have no idea about**

When I become a reliable person, I will be daring. Taking on what I don’t know how to do and doing it with all my might, because I want to do it. I even have a success story. One day I stood at a meetup and talked about something I had no idea about.

This story brought me into normal development. One day, at the beginning of my career, a more experienced friend and I decided to go to a hackathon. He had some crazy idea, which he talked about with sparkling eyes.

He said that he wanted to make a bot that would automate sales and completely replace the first line of technical support. I was just starting out then and it seemed very daring.

We went to a hackathon and started making a project. And they continued to do it afterwards. And over time it developed. Our worldview was very contrasting - such a daring founder and such a modest me.

It always seemed to me that he was exaggerating what we were doing. For example, we did not have any complex artificial intelligence system. Our landing page told how cool everything is with us. At some point, I changed my main job and left, but that guy continued to be insolent. And now he has his own IT company. This sunk into my soul and I decided to talk about it at the meetup. I was invited to our local Penza meetup and I spoke about machine learning, without actually having a line of code in machine learning. And everyone liked it.

The funny thing is that if you take on a little more than you know how to do, you can do it by spending some time on preparation. But you will get a lot of experience, and you will get a cool story that you can tell your friends. The main thing is that no one gets hurt: honesty + audacity = hustle.

**ACT 3. Love.**

One project. A contstruction company and me:

- Come on, I’ll make you a cool website

- Wow, you're so businesslike, come on.
And I started to grow wildly as a front-end developer. There was complex layout, scroll-hijacking, custom animations.

I still remember the first release, everything is super beautiful, I log in via FTP and upload the site, configured nginx. I’m writing to them, look out. And manager' monitor is a mess. She says nothing works at all. And then my self-confidence begins to fade. I delayed the site, constantly pushing back deadlines.
And in the end I finished it.

The funny thing is that I was constantly whining the whole way. This is probably not what they expected. Now I understand that it was obvious that I didn’t want to do this. And what I learned: your problems are not the customer’s problems. And true love is when you yourself are responsible for your pain. In fact, this is very difficult and we are designed in such a way that we want to justify ourselves. **And true love is good service**. As a result of this story, by the way, she didn’t go for a walk with me.

  Honesty + audacity + love for yourself and others = drive.

**Being on a hustle. Fear of failure**

The leitmotif of all this growth is an unpleasant sensation in the ass area. It seems like you are having failure after failure. The funny thing is that I look back and understand that each of these awkward stories, not only did not harm me. But I really grow after them. Of course, a smart person will immediately do everything right and grow very quickly. But I’m just driven and growing through the cringe.
****If you feel that you are stuck in your career or in life in general, then perhaps you should take some kind of adventure. This will add a little variety to your personal life, and at first it will be painful and unpleasant, and then normal.

Now everyone is afraid of a recession, layoffs everywhere. Some even predict that the IT bubble will burst and you will have to get a normal job. Well, for example, I decided that I would move according to hassle. IT is a very good school for your personality, which develops you quite harmoniously from all sides. And now we can be good punctual tire fitters, salesmen and entrepreneurs.
